# Google Contacts API Guide
Hello there, today I will be teaching you how to create, edit, and delete contacts from Node.JS, and this works on both IOS and Android.

I just want to say that I spent some time researching and documenting my methods here, so if you like my work, drop me a donation on [PayPal](https://paypal.me/RajehTaher).

## Getting Started

Start up your Node.JS project, and install the [`googleapis`](https://npmjs.com/package/googleapis) package. More details there if you want to learn more.

Go to Google Cloud Platform (no need for trial), Create a project, go to APIs and Services, select Library, and then select the People API (and not the contacts API)
